The Linux boot sequence is a multi-step process that happens when the system is powered on or restarted. It involves several stages, each performing different tasks to prepare the system for use. Here's an overview of the Linux boot process:

### 1. **BIOS/UEFI (Basic Input/Output System / Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)**
   - **Purpose**: This is the first step when you power on the system. The BIOS/UEFI initializes hardware components (like the CPU, RAM, and storage devices) and runs a power-on self-test (POST).
   - **Action**: It then looks for a bootable device (like a hard drive, SSD, or USB drive) by checking the boot order.

### 2. **Bootloader (GRUB)**
   - **Purpose**: Once the BIOS/UEFI finds a bootable device, it hands over control to the bootloader, typically **GRUB** (Grand Unified Bootloader) in most Linux distributions.
   - **Action**: GRUB presents a menu (if multiple OSes are installed) and loads the kernel into memory. It also passes kernel parameters to configure the system (like boot options and hardware configurations).

### 3. **Kernel Initialization**
   - **Purpose**: The Linux kernel is loaded into memory and initialized.
   - **Action**: The kernel detects and configures hardware, sets up system resources (like memory, processes, and devices), mounts the root filesystem (usually from a hard drive or SSD), and starts the **init** process (or its equivalent, like **systemd**).

### 4. **Init/Systemd**
   - **Purpose**: **init** or **systemd** (in modern distributions) is the first user-space process that gets executed. It is responsible for starting all other processes needed for the system to operate.
   - **Action**: It reads configuration files (like **/etc/inittab** for **init** or **/etc/systemd/system/** for **systemd**) and starts services and background processes, including network, logging, and the graphical interface.

### 5. **Runlevel/Target Initialization**
   - **Purpose**: In the case of **init**, the system enters a predefined runlevel (0 to 6). In **systemd**, the system enters a target.
   - **Action**: For example, runlevel 3 is multi-user, command-line mode, while runlevel 5 is graphical mode. **systemd** uses targets, such as **multi-user.target** or **graphical.target**.

### 6. **Startup Services**
   - **Purpose**: Background services and daemons (like network, cron jobs, SSH, etc.) are started by **init** or **systemd**.
   - **Action**: Services are initialized based on configurations, and the system is ready for user login.

### 7. **Login/Interactive Shell**
   - **Purpose**: Once all services are running, the system presents a login prompt.
   - **Action**: The user logs in, either via a text console (for command-line login) or a graphical display manager (like **GDM**, **LightDM**, or **SDDM** for GUI login).

### 8. **User Environment Initialization**
   - **Purpose**: After login, the user's shell environment is initialized.
   - **Action**: Files like **~/.bashrc**, **~/.profile**, or **~/.zshrc** are executed to set up environment variables and user-specific configurations.
